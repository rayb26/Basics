# CS6704 SE Basics Workshop

## Overview of Discussion for Standup Activity

Partner Name: Mehmet Yardimci 
PID: oguzy


In our discussion, Mehmet and I talked about what we did, our current 
standing of the work, and anything that is blocking us. For Mehmet, he 
talked about his ongoing research and said how currently, he is using a 
new tool for his GIS project as part of his PhD studies. As part of that, 
he said he has no blockers and and currently trying to learn the tool for 
future work. For me, since I am doing a Masters of Engineering, I could 
not really talk about any kind of project I am working on, but I just 
described how my classes were and that I was not blocked on anything.
